## [1.0.0] - 2019-10-19

### Added

* This repository used to be "project-template", a template for Chisel-based projects. Through tighter integration of multiple projects from the Berkeley Architecture Research group at UC Berkeley, this repository is re-released as Chipyard - a framework for agile hardware development of RISC-V based Systems-on-Chip.
