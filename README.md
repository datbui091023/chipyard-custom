## Using Chipyard

To get started using Chipyard, see the documentation on the Chipyard documentation site: https://bar-project-template.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

## What is Chipyard

Chipyard is an open source starter template for your custom Chisel project.
It will allow you to leverage the Chisel HDL, Rocket Chip SoC generator, and other [Berkeley][berkeley] projects to produce a [RISC-V][riscv] SoC with everything from MMIO-mapped peripherals to custom accelerators.
It contains processor cores ([Rocket][rocket-chip], [BOOM][boom]), accelerators ([Hwacha][hwacha]), FPGA simulation tools ([FireSim][firesim]), ASIC tools ([HAMMER][hammer]) and other tooling to help create a full featured SoC.
Chipyard is actively developed in the [Berkeley Architecture Research Group][ucb-bar] in the [Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences Department][eecs] at the [University of California, Berkeley][berkeley].
