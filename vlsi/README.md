This is the starting point for a vlsi flow from this repository.

This flow will not work without the necessary CAD and technology plugins for HAMMER.

If you are a UCB-affiliate, you may be able to acquire access to the tech-plugins.

# Initial Setup Instructions (For All technologies)
Run the `init-vlsi.sh` script to pull correct versions of hammer, hammer-cad-plugins, and the hammer-tech-plugins
```scripts/init-vlsi.sh TECH_NAME```
