Commericial Software RTL Simulators
==============================
The ReBAR framework currently supports only the VCS commerical simulator

VCS
-----------------------
VCS is a commercial RTL simulator developed by Synopsys. It requires commerical licenses.
The ReBAR framework can compile and execute simulations using VCS. VCS simulation will generally compile
faster than Verilator simulations.

To run a simulation using VCS, perform the following steps:

Make sure that the VCS simulator is on your `PATH`.

To compile the example design, run make in the ``sims/vsim`` directory.
This will elaborate the DefaultExampleConfig in the example project.

An executable called simulator-example-DefaultExampleConfig will be produced.
This executable is a simulator that has been compiled based on the design that was built.
You can then use this executable to run any compatible RV64 code. For instance,
to run one of the riscv-tools assembly tests.

::
    ./simulator-example-DefaultExampleConfig $RISCV/riscv64-unknown-elf/share/riscv-tests/isa/rv64ui-p-simple

If you later create your own project, you can use environment variables to
build an alternate configuration.

::
    make PROJECT=yourproject CONFIG=YourConfig
    ./simulator-yourproject-YourConfig ...

If you would like to extract waveforms from the simulation, run the command ``make debug`` instead of just ``make``. This will generate a vpd file (this is a proprietry waveform representation format used by Synopsys) that can be loaded to vpd-supported waveform viewers. If you have Synopsys licenses, we recommend using the DVE waveform viewers
