Simulators
=======================

ReBAR provides support and intergration for multiple simulation flows, for various user levels and requirments.
In the majority of cases during a digital design development process, simple software RTL. When more advanced full-system evaluation is required, with long running workloads, FPGA-accelerated simulation will then become a preferable solution. The following pages provide detailed information about the simulation possibilities within the ReBAR framework.
