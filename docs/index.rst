Welcome to ReBAR's documentation!
=================================

ReBAR is a a framework for designing and evaluating full-system hardware using agile teams. It is composed of a collection of tools and libraries designed to provide an intergration between open-source and commercial tools for the development of systems-on-chip. New to ReBAR?
