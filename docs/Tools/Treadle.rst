Treadle and FIRRTL Interpreter
==============================

`Treadle <https://github.com/freechipsproject/treadle>`__ and `FIRRTL Interpreter <https://github.com/freechipsproject/firrtl-interpreter>`__
are circuit simulators that directly execute FIRRTL (specifically low-firrtl IR).
They are especially useful for interactive debugging and many of projects within Chipyard
use them for a low-overhead simulator.
