Barstools
===============================

Barstools is a collection of useful FIRRTL transformations and compilers to help the build process.
Included in the tools are a MacroCompiler (used to map Chisel memory constructs to vendor SRAMs), FIRRTL transforms (to separate harness and top-level SoC files), and more.
