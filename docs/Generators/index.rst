Generators
============================
Generator can be thought of as generalized RTL designs, written using a mix of meta-programming and standard RTL.
This type of meta-programming is enabled by the Chisel hardware description framework embedded in Scala. 
A standard RTL design is esentially a degenerate form of a generator. However, by using meta-programming and parameter systems, generators can allow for integration of complex hardware designs in automated ways. The following pages introduce the generators integrated with the ReBAR framework.
