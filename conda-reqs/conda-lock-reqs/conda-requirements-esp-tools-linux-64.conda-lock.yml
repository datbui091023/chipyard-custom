# This lock file was generated by conda-lock (https://github.com/conda-incubator/conda-lock). DO NOT EDIT!
#
# A "lock file" contains a concrete list of package versions (with checksums) to be installed. Unlike
# e.g. `conda env create`, the resulting environment will not change as new package versions become
# available, unless you explicitly update the lock file.
#
# Install this environment as "YOURENV" with:
#     conda-lock install -n YOURENV --file conda-requirements-esp-tools-linux-64.conda-lock.yml
# To update a single package to the latest version compatible with the version constraints in the source:
#     conda-lock lock --lockfile conda-requirements-esp-tools-linux-64.conda-lock.yml --update PACKAGE
# To re-solve the entire environment, e.g. after changing a version constraint in the source file:
